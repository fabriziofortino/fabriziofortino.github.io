Here is a list of independent projects I had fun with in the past.

## RTE - Standards in Public Office
> Investigating Corruption with Graph Relationships

![rte standards in public office](/images/rte.png "RTE")


[Standards in Public Office](https://www.rte.ie/news/investigations-unit/2015/1207/751833-rte-investigates/) is an award-winning documentary, produced by the Investigations Unit of [RTÄ–](https://www.rte.ie/) (Ireland's National Television), to shed the light on the widespread under-declaration of assets by politicians.

I have architected and implemented a graph-based system to support the journalists' research activity to identify elected representatives apparently seeking personal benefits for public works. A technical case study can be found [here](https://medium.com/@dubey/investigating-corruption-with-orientdb-rte-investigation-unit-report-a6f0f02853d).

Tech Stack: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/), [OrientDB](https://orientdb.org/), [Duke](https://github.com/larsga/Duke).

## Shoemondo - Beta
> The Shoes Search Engine

[Shoemondo](https://www.shoemondo.com/uk) helps to find your next favourite pair of shoes by comparing across a variety of online stores. In the first step, 12 partners were integrated to enable an extensive range of shoes.

I have designed and implemented the whole backend system from the data ingestion phase to the APIs to search and get products.

Tech Stack: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
