The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hadoop-user-group-ireland/events/229509552/" target="_blank">Ireland Hadoop User Group</a> organized an event themed on Graph Databases. I was invited as <a href="http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/" target="_blank">OrientDB</a> contributor. My talk "OrientDB: Unlock the Value of Document Data Relationships" was focused on how to combine the flexibility of documents with the power of graphs while incorporating object oriented paradigm concepts. I shared my experience with OrientDB presenting a real use case I worked on in the last year.

It has been a great experience for me (my first public talk in front of such a big audience). I had the pleasure to meet a lot of passionate people, share ideas and discuss different point of views. Looking forward to the next event!!!
